This is just a minimal PoC for an "interesting" idea.

I just changed `USB_CFG_VENDOR_ID` and `USB_CFG_DEVICE_ID` in the `usbconfig.h` file
to emulate an ICOM-7300.


Sniff traffic generated by WSJT-X:

```
socat /dev/ic7300,raw,echo=0 \
  SYSTEM:'tee in.txt | socat - "PTY,link=/tmp/ic7300,raw,echo=0,waitslave" | tee out.txt'

hexdump in.txt
```

This technique works! :)
